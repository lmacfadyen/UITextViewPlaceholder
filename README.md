# UITextViewPlaceholder

This project implements UITextView with placeholder text, and is written in Swift. It is implemented as a subclass of UIView using a Xib, and supports IBDesignable and IBInspectable.

The 2 classes (.xib and .swift) can be dropped into any project and specified as the custom class of a UIView in your Storyboard or Xib, with the placeholder text configurable in Interface Builder.

This accompanies a tutorial here: http://www.iosinsight.com/uitextview-placeholder-text-swift/
